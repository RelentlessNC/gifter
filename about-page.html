                This project will combine all of our knowledge we’ve learned in the UTA bootcamp up til this point. 
                This project is surrounding an application that will take a date input and save it to local storage 
                and then once you’re within a specified timeframe of the date added, we’ll notify the user so that 
                they’re able to select a specific gift/card/flower to send to their intended receiver. We’ll also have 
                a viewing area for all the users event’s they’ve saved so they can be sure they don’t forget any special event ever again.

            <div class="six columns aboutText">
                Have you ever looked at the calendar and had a wave of anxiety and fear rush over your body like a 
                cold chill, as it slowly dawns upon you that you forgot to wish a special person in your life, Happy 
                Birthday or Happy Anniversary, or even good luck on an event? Well if this hasn’t happened to you, 
                please move along, but if you’re like us, this application is designed for you and your peace of mind! 
                This application is designed to remember important events and not only remember, but celebrate these events 
                as well. With Gifter, you’ll be able to input a specific date and label it as a certain event. Once you’ve 
                got it saved, we’ll do the rest from there. When you arrive within two weeks till the event you submitted, 
                we’ll send you a reminder as well as different options on how to celebrate that person or event. For example, 
                Mother’s day is Sunday, May 14th of 2023 and we’ll give you a reminder on Sunday, April 30th with different 
                options of things you can send directly from Gifter. You’ll get an option to send a gift card, flowers, or 
                even a letter which you can style personally to let that person know you really care. With Gifter, you’ll be 
                known as the friend/family member/partner that never forgets the important things and you’ll be sure to soar 
                with all of your relationships.

    <!-- Note: columns can be nested, but it's not recommended since Skeleton's grid has %-based gutters, meaning a nested grid results in variable with gutters (which can end up being *really* small on certain browser/device sizes) -->
